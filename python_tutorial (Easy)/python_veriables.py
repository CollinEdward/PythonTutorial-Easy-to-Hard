# Creating veriables

# Python has no command for declaring a variable. like int, string, float etc etc...

# When we make a veriable, python is automatically going to assign it to a 'type' fx int, string etc...
x = 10
y = "150" # Here we are making two different kinda of veriables, a intiger (number) and a string (text)


print(x)
print(y)
