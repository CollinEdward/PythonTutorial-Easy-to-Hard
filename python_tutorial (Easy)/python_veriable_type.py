# veriable types

x = int(1)   # x will be 1 (normal intiger) same as x = 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2 because we specified the type (int)
z = int("3") # z will be 3 Here even tho we put 3 inside the string, it will convert it to intiger because of the type being specified as int


x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0 # all of these are going to be decimal numbers, and there will always be a '.' something even if you are giving it a full number 
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2


x = str("s1") # x will be 's1' # All of these will be printed out as strings, because the str function front of ()
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
