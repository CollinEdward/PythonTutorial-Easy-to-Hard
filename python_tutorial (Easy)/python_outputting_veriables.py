# Outputting veriables

# Here we assign veriable x to the string world!
x = "world!"
# Then we can print out a string and then use the operator + and then call that veriable in the print function
print("Hello " + x)

# we can do this as many times as we want

x = "Hello "
y = "World"
z = "!"

print(x + y + z) # And it's going to print the same as the one shown above


# We can also do the same with intigers, but this will output something else (Math)

# Here we assign veriable x and y to the values of 10 and 100 (intigers)
x = 10
y = 100

print(x + y) # print it out and plus together

# insted of it saying 10100 it says 110, this is because we are adding two intigers together and doing math
# insted of adding two strings together

# we can not add a string and an intiger together, that would give us an error because one is an intiger and the other a string
