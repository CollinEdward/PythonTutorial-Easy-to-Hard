# PythonTutorial-Easy-to-Hard
This is a python helper / tutorial course that goes from easy to hard. 

You can download all the files previews and folders by typing:
git clone https://github.com/CollinEdward/PythonTutorial-Easy-to-Hard.git
cd PythonTutorial-Easy-to-Hard
ls

There you will see the .py files

(I know right now there is only a easy folder, but there will be added a medium and hard)
