# python operators

# making two veriables that we can add together via the python operatores (math)
x = 32
y = 2

print(x + y)
# here we use the operator plus (+) we can add these two veriables together and get the output where the machine does the math

# There A LOT of python operatores we can use, and here under there are some more operatores in python


# the are some of the most common math operatores in python, but there are more
# + 	Addition	x + y	
# - 	Subtraction	x - y	
# * 	Multiplication	x * y	
# / 	Division	x / y	
# % 	Modulus	x % y	
# ** 	Exponentiation	x ** y	
# // 	Floor division	x // y

# Then we have
#       x equal 5
# =	    x = 5	x = 5	
# plus 3 to x
# += 	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# minus 3 from x
# -= 	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# multiple 3 to x
# *= 	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# devide 3 x
# /= 	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# Modulus
# %= 	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# 	Floor division
# //= 	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# Exponentiation
# **= 	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	



# There are also something called comparison operators

# which look like this:

# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	


# Then we have the logical operators

# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)


# Identity operators

# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y
