# python has lists


list1 = ["1","2","3"]
# making a list, and calling it list1

# then now we can print out what items are in the list1 list
print(list1)


# we can also get the lenght of a list

list1 = ["1","2","3"]

print(len(list1)) # which is going to be 3, because it has 3 items



list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(list1)
list1 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
print(list1)
list1 = [True, False, False]
print(list1)
list1 = [1+1,2+2,3+3]
print(list1)
# as shown above, we can write anything in a list (bools, intigers, strings)
# and it prints out what we write. we can also use operators in the lists

# we can store a lot of things inside of lists

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
print(list1) # if it's a string, then in the output it's going to put '' around the item to show it.


# we can also call something specific inside a list

print(list1[1]) # python uses indexing in lists. item 1 has index 0. that's why when we write 1, it's going to print out the second thing
